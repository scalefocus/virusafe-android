# Contributing to ViruSafe

Welcome! We are glad for your interest in contributing to ViruSafe.

There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

Before anything else, please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). We expect all participants, from full-timers to occasional tinkerers, to uphold it.

## Reporting Issues

If you have found an issue in ViruSafe, or you would like to see a new feature, please report that in the following ways.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Make sure that the issue hasn't already been reported by somebody else by using the filter.
If you do find a similar issue, make sure to fill in what you think is missing, if you think it's related.

You can also always express your opinion on an existing issue by upvoting (👍) or downvoting (👎) it, which helps us prioritise our work.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you can't find an issue like yours already submitted, you can always submit one yourself. Please make sure to be as expressive and include as much additional information as you can.

The following would be very helpful when submimtting Bug Reports:
* Version of the application 
    * You can find that in the applications page in the settings app
* The OS of the device
    * If you could try to reproduce the issue on all operating systems the app supports that would be very helpful, but not required.
* Steps to reproduce
* Actual and expected behavior
* Screenshots, animations, etc., showing the issue
* Errors, if any, in the logs of the OS, that result from the issue.

### Follow Your Issue

Once you have submitted the issue, it helps if you continue answering questions and adding additional information.

## Contributing Code

Make sure to create an issue that's related to your code, if such already doesn't exist. That way it can be prioritized what PRs should be merged first.

Here are a couple of points to keep in mind before contributing code:

* All pull requests must be associated with a specific Issue. If an issue doesn't exist please first create it.
* Before you submit your pull request, search the repository for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* All code contributions pass through pull requests. If you haven't created a pull request before, we recommend this free video series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
* Commiting your code
    * Each commit should have a single clear purpose. If a commit contains multiple unrelated changes, those changes should be split into separate commits.
    * If a commit requires another commit to build properly, those commits should be squashed.
    * Follow-up commits for any review comments should be squashed. Do not include "Fixed PR comments", merge commits, or other "temporary" commits in pull requests.

Please follow the coding guidelines.

PRs from all users (no matter internal or external to the company) would be checked with the same degree of diligence by the maintainers.
